# Introduction
In modern society, the phenomenon of individuals, particularly youths, living in isolation is not just a personal issue but a significant societal challenge. Originally identified in Japan as "Hikikomori," this issue has seen a concerning rise in South Korea, largely attributed to the high youth unemployment rates and the stark disparities in working conditions between large corporations and smaller businesses. The economic and social ramifications of this issue are profound, with an estimated annual loss of 5.6 billion dollars due to the withdrawal of these young individuals from the workforce, leading to a decrease in societal vitality and potential disintegration of family structures.

Sunshine is a pioneering solution designed to address this growing concern by facilitating the reintegration of isolated youths into society. Through a 70-day program that employs a gamification approach, Sunshine aims to provide these individuals with a sense of purpose and achievement, thereby encouraging their active participation in social and economic activities. 

The program is structured around four key categories:
- Physical Health: Encouraging participants to engage in physical activities to improve their overall health and well-being.
- Mental Strength: Fostering mental resilience and emotional stability through mindfulness and self-reflection exercises.
- Socialization: Gradually reintroducing participants to social interactions to rebuild their confidence in engaging with others.
- Skill Development: Offering opportunities to acquire new skills or hone existing ones to enhance their employability and personal growth.

Participants embark on a variety of daily quests within these categories, each designed to promote recovery and build resilience. By completing these quests, they earn experience points and rewards, creating a continuous loop of engagement and achievement. This method not only aids in their personal development but also prepares them for reintegration into the workforce and society at large.

As the program concludes, participants are not only better equipped to face the challenges of modern life but are also connected with various job opportunities, setting the stage for their next chapter in life. Sunshine thus serves as a bridge between isolated youths and a more fulfilling, engaged existence, contributing significantly to the broader goal of Decent Work and Economic Growth as outlined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

In essence, Sunshine is more than just an app; it's a movement towards healing, empowerment, and societal integration, offering a beacon of hope for those who have retreated from the world. Through this innovative approach, we not only address the immediate challenge of isolation but also pave the way for a more inclusive, vibrant society where every individual has the opportunity to thrive.
